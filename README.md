# Tiberius Folder
## How to add code
In case I come back to this in the future and forget what I'm doing here, my learning routine is:
1. find online any algorithm coding challenge
2. solve its logic in a controller file
3. add a panel in views
4. connect the panel(s) back to index.php somehow
5. styling is currently at the top of index.php
6. to run it locally: `php -S localhost:8000`

If you are visiting this site, I think the above steps will work if you have php installed and you have cloned this site.
## Folder structure
* index.php is at the top level
* other layouts go in the views folder (these are all children of index.php)
* nearly all of the logic goes in the controllers folder
There are also these:
* tests folder
* images are in resources/images
* src folder got sort of forgotten.  these other folders should be under it but they're not
## Resources
* [Symfonycasts](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/phpunit): *PHPUnit: Testing with a Bite.*  (paid site).
* David Powers PHP 7 (book)
* basic useage of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md)
* the actual challenge questions come from Stanford University's Compsci Dept: [codingbat](https://codingbat.com/)

## The Historical Tiberius
I needed a naming system that gave my project folders an implied sequence.  This one is Tiberius, the next is Caligula. 

BTW, there are new Daniel Voshart caesar reconstructions.  Including a realistic reconstruction of [Tiberius](https://www.ancient.eu/image/12979/tiberius-facial-reconstruction/)
